# as_the_cube_turns
IMP4 unit translated to Python

"As the Cube Turns" is a 5-week unit of study in the fourth year of the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP). The unit begins with the problem to display a rotating cube on your TI graphing calculator. Solving the problem involves development of both mathematics and coding. 

The matheamtics includes (may still add):
	– transformations, including translation and rotation, including in three dimensions
	– matrix arithmetic
	– projective geometry

Coding includes (initial draft):
	– programming basics: variable, display, ...
	– loops
	– subroutines (functions?)

My big aim is to translate the original code designed for the TI-82, 83, or 84 into Python. And then I intend to update the curriculum to provide students and teachers resources to be able to use this unit with Python instead of or in addition to the TI calculator.

For now, what is hear are all my projects as I am just learning Python (and modern coding) for the first time! It has been 20 years, so my learing curve is steep.

A little about me – I used to teach high school mathematics, and this was one of my favorite units. I am now a mathematics professor, and most of my work is with teachers, new and experienced. They all want better tasks / units, and I am hoping this may be of interest.
